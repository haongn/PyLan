Deleting/Updating from a String

In Python, Updation or deletion of characters from a String is not allowed. 
This will cause an error because item assignment or item deletion from a String is not supported. 
Although deletion of the entire String is possible with the use of a built-in del keyword. 
This is because Strings are immutable, hence elements of a String cannot be changed once it has 
been assigned. 
Only new strings can be reassigned to the same name.
