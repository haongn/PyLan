A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, 
mutable and has no duplicate elements. (lap duoc, thay doi duoc, khong co phan tu lap)

Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.

The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized 
method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
This is based on a data structure known as a hash table.

Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes like we do in lists.
