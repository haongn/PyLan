# Algorithm:  

# 1. Create a solution matrix, initially filled with 0â€™s.
# 2. Create a recursive function, which takes initial matrix, output matrix and position 
# of rat (i, j).
# 3. if the position is out of the matrix or the position is not valid then return.
# 4. Mark the position output[i][j] as 1 and check if the current position is destination or not. If destination is reached print the output matrix and return.
# 5. Recursively call for position (i+1, j) and (i, j+1).
# 6. Unmark position (i, j), i.e output[i][j] = 0.
